# Game Play:
Move the arrow keys to move the player. The player can move up, down, left or right. The player is limited to moving within the game board.
If the player comes into contact with any roaches he will be moved back to his original position at the bottom of the board.

# Winning: 
To win the game you must move the player to the water without coming into contact with any of the roaches. An alert will pop up at the top of the screen letting you know that you have won.

# Future Updates:
* Adding increasingly difficult levels
* Adding a timer function to show how long it took to reach the water
* Adding score area
* Adding blocks that the player must move around
